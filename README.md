# Dp-data-structure: a personal project for learning data structures

By implementing them in Javascript

## Tech Used (so far)

So far I used: 

- Typescript: because I love it :heart: !
- Rollup: Testing for the first time instead of Webpack. Pretty nice so far :thumbsup: 
- Jest: just to change from jasmine that I use at work :flamingo: 
- RomeJS: a toolchain for FrontEnd, right now used only for linting :it:
